Unravel the intricacies of virtual memory, including page tables, address translation, and
page replacement algorithms. Discuss how virtual memory enables efficient memory
management and supports the execution of multiple processes concurrently. Explore the
concept of virtual machines and their relationship to the memory hierarchy.
 Cross-Cutting Issues
Address the challenges and trade-offs involved in designing memory hierarchies. Consider
factors like cost, power consumption, complexity, and the impact of different workloads on
performance. Discuss emerging trends and technologies that are shaping the future of
memory hierarchy design.
Part 2: Implementing and Analyzing Cache Configurations in gem5
Introduction
In this hands-on section, you will leverage the power of the gem5 simulator to gain practical
experience with memory hierarchy design principles. Specifically, you'll focus on the cache
subsystem, which plays a crucial role in bridging the performance gap between the CPU and
main memory. By setting up and running simulations, you'll witness firsthand how various
cache configurations can influence system performance. Moreover, you'll explore the
concept of virtual memory, a vital mechanism for efficient memory management in modern
systems.
Setting Up gem5:
Environment Setup: Follow the instructions to set up gem5, ensuring you have the latest
version and necessary dependencies installed.
Carefully follow the gem5 installation instructions to set up the simulator on your system.
Ensure you have the latest version of gem5 installed and all necessary dependencies
are met. You may need to consult the gem5 documentation or online resources for
guidance specific to your operating system.
Configuration: Configure gem5 to simulate a system with an x86 architecture. Pay
particular attention to the cache subsystem settings, as this will be the focus of your
experiments. Refer to the gem5 documentation for details on how to configure cache
parameters such as size, associativity, and block size.
Simulation of Cache Performance:
 D Default Cache Configuration
Begin by running a simulation using gem5's default cache settings. This will establish a
baseline for comparison. Record essential performance metrics, including cache hit rate,
miss rate, and average memory access latency.
 Optimizing Cache Parameters
Systematically modify various cache configuration parameters, such as cache size,
associativity, and block size. For each modification, rerun the simulation and record the
updated performance metrics. Aim to improve the overall cache performance, and
carefully document the changes you make and their rationale.
 Analysis
Compare the performance metrics obtained before and after each optimization. Analyze
how each change in cache configuration affected the results. Relate your observations
to the advanced cache optimization techniques discussed in the theoretical part of the
assignment (e.g., prefetching, victim caches).
Virtual Memory Exploration:
4. Virtual Memory Exploration:
 Virtual Memory Simulation
Configure gem5 to simulate a system with virtual memory enabled. Experiment with
different page sizes and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) configurations.
 Performance Metrics
Analyze the performance impact of your virtual memory configuration choices. Focus on
metrics such as page fault rate and TLB miss rate, and how these influence overall
system performance.
 Hands-On Discussion
Reflect on the role of virtual memory in modern operating systems and how TLB
configurations can impact system performance. Connect your experimental findings to
the theoretical concepts you've learned about virtual memory management.
Remember:
 Document your experimental setup, including the benchmark program used, gem5
configuration details, and any modifications made.
 Use clear and well-labeled graphs or tables to present your performance data.
 Provide insightful analysis, explaining the observed trends and relating them to
theoretical principles.
 Store all files and documents in a private github repository and ensure that your
professor is the only person with access to the repository.
